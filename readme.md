```

A. Yes, this works with any removable drive as it uses relative paths to binary files.

Q. Does this work on Windows Vista?

A. This application works on any computer with any Windows from XP onwards.

Q. Can I omit a category without updating `bins.list`?

A. Yes but any applications within that category won't be visible on the launcher app.
